# Tetrix_game_jam
Realization of a game in the space of 2 days/alone.  
We had the right to the language we wanted and the libraries we wanted.  
So I decided to start in c++ with SFML to make me discover a new technology.  
The game is simply a two-court tetrix where different pieces on each court fall at the same time.
